# Brio

Brio is a small utility designed to assist with the management and control of actors in GPose.
It currently allows the creation and deletion of GPose actors which can then be used by tools like Anamnesis (Penumbra integration required) and Ktisis. 

It is expected that actor creation functionality will become available within Ktisis directly very soon (I'm working on it, I promise)!

In the future, Brio will focus on quality of life for those making animation videos. Combining the XAT camera plugin (to be retired) with easy syncing of actors etc.
