# Brio
Brio is a small utility designed to assist with the management and control of actors in GPose.
It is designed to enhance the experience of users no matter which posing tool they use, whether it be [Anamnesis](https://github.com/imchillin/Anamnesis) or [Ktisis](https://github.com/ktisis-tools/Ktisis).

## Features
* Creation and Deletion of GPose actors
* Redraw control of GPose Actors
* NPC Appearance Hack (Allows you to apply NPC appearances to players without breaking tools like Penumbra)

## Installation
1. Add the custom Dalamud repo `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AsgardXIV/Brio/main/repo.json`
2. Enable the `Brio` plugin
3. Run the `/brio` command

## Support
Brio is still early in Alpha so issues are expected.
